<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a serious condition that affects
around 20% of twin pregnancies with monochorial (MC) placenta. The syndrome is
caused by the presence of small anastomoses in the vasculature of the placenta
that let the twins exchange blood volume and is generally fatal if left
untreated. The first line treatment of severe TTTS between 16 and 26 weeks is
fetoscopic laser photocoagulation, which is associated to improved survival
rates for at least one of the twins. However, in up to 33% of treated
pregnancies, some inter-twin vascular connections remain open and this can
cause a recurrence of the TTTS in later gestation weeks. 
The surgery is in fact very complex and risky, because of several constraints
proper of the fetal clinical setting: the placenta position, size and shape
varies a lot between pregnancies. Also this is a one shot procedure. If, once
inside the uterus, the surgeon is not able to reach and coagulate all the
anastomoses, reentry in a different point is not an option, as it is associated
with high mortality. For all these reasons, the choice of the correct entry
point is probably the most critical factor of the intervention as it directly
affects the maneuverability of the fetoscope and the possibility to reach all
the anastomoses. 
In this paper we present a software for planning the insertion trajectory
taking into account the specific localization of the placenta.</p> </p>
