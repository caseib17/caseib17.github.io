<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The so called “Additive manufacturing” is a new manufacturing process which
consists in translating virtual solid model data into physical models in a
quick and easy process. The most known example is 3D printing. In the present
work, this novel technology will be used to print scaffolds with biomaterials.
Due to the problems that arise when controlling the clinical course of an
implant, graft or polymer inside the human body, an innovative idea has
emerged: it consists in incorporating particles of barium sulfate in order to
increase the radiopacity of the PLLA and thus making these materials visible to
X-rays.
Accordingly, BaSO4 loaded PLLA composites were prepared via melt-blending and
were fully characterized in terms of thermal transitions, mechanical
properties, morphology and radiopacity. X-ray analyses confirmed the enhanced
radiopacity of the BaSO4 filled composites in comparison to their unfilled
counterparts. It is demonstrated that the loads not only contribute to the
material's radiopacity, but also dramatically improve its ductility. As an
illustration, the incorporation of 10 wt.% of BaSO4 particles resulted in an
outstanding 1647% and 3338% increase in toughness and elongation of PLLA
matrix, respectively. Moreover, it should be noted that the resulting materials
are printable and can be molded with any shape in a matter of minutes, making
the use of this technology appealing for further innovations.</p> </p>
