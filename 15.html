<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Health acquired infections (HAIs) are a major public health problems that cause an alarming number of victims in worldwide. Copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles have several properties, one of which is their strong antimicrobial potential. CuO nanofluids were prepared and applied in an Escherichia coli culture to evaluate their antibacterial potential. The effect of increasing the temperature and concentration of the nanofluids on their electrical conductivity and their pH was also evaluated, showing that the increase in temperature and the increase of the nanoparticles in volume, promote the increase of the electrical conductivity of the nanofluids. It has been found that the temperature makes the nanofluids quite reactive, which is reflected in the inconstancy of their pH value. As for the microbiological test performed, it was not possible to prove the antibacterial potential of CuO nanofluids. The same happened with the hospital disinfectant used, which may suggest that the microbiological test used was not the most adequate.</p> </p>
