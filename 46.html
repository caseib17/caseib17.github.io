<h4>Powering implants by galvanic coupling: a preliminary analysis</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The galvanic coupling barely has been used for powering biomedical implants despite it is an advantageous and functional power transfer method. </p>

<p>In this study has been analyzed the maximum power that an implant can draw when it is powered by means of the galvanic coupling. It has been done through an analytical model where the implant has been modeled as two spherical electrodes 
separated by a distance equivalent to its length. </p>

<p>The obtained results shown that powers in the order of 1 mW can be obtained in short implants when currents which comply with safety standards flow through the tissues where the implants are located. Additionally analytically has been demonstrated that for the studied model the maximum power transferred to an implant is independent of the tissue conductivity.</p> </p>
