<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Decision Trees (DTs) are an interpretable knowledge-representation which
provides an estimate of a target variable, by posing sequential decisions. They
have potential for clinical integration, as clinical guidelines are often
presented as DTs. Moreveover, they are already used in guidelines as risk
scoring models. Although recent learning algorithms achieve higher predictive
accuracy, they do not offer sufficent explanations. As a matter of fact, a
novel deep learning approach to cardiovascular event prediction highlights the
challenges in understanding the predictions, and stresses the importance of
supporting visualizations.</p>

<p>In the clinic, we wish to provide the best possible risk prediction with the
smallest possible number of patient measurements. Learning the best DT for a
problem is NP-complete. Locally-optimal approaches offer a good trade-off
between computational complexity and prediction accuracy, but they do not
guarantee a DT which minimizes the decision cost. A DT is a static model,
although clinical reality is highly dynamic. An ideal decision support tool is
able to adapt to context changes. We propose an algorithm for non-greedy DT
learning, which outputs a large space of DTs. The clinician can interact with
this output, by selecting the best model for the specific context.</p> </p>
