<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>A common problem for young patients is localized cartilage damage. This can
heal, but often results in a painful condition that requires intervention. A
welded-woven three-dimensional polymer fabric has been suggested as a suitable
cartilage replacement because such materials closely match the mechanical
properties of artificial cartilage. However, such materials fare poorly when
evaluated with respect to wear. A microscopic investigation of wear mechanisms
showed that it is critical that the fibers not deflect laterally under a normal
load. This observation led to the use of a new process for selective laser
welding of the surface layers of three-dimensional fabrics in order to improve
their wear resistance. Experimental evaluations were made in a pin-on-disc
arrangement with a biomimetic loading. All materials used in the studies have
previously been used in orthopaedic devices. The wear rates were significantly
reduced and the lifespan of the fabrics was markedly improved due to surface
welding, making this a viable option for cartilage replacement in vivo.</p> </p>
