<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The characterization of the bone microarchitecture from MR or CT is
significantly relevant in order to predict the risk of bone fracture. Our
purpose was to evaluate the accuracy of our bone pipeline based on
computational algorithms extracting Imaging Biomarkers and integrate them in a
new parameter to assess bone fracture: Quality of Trabecular Structure (QTS)
and compare it to the reference standard under different imaging modalities.
The reference is based on synthetic bones, consisting of 10 samples, 5 with 15%
and 5 with 30% of material density that was acquired from SAWBONES®
(Washington, USA) with a known mass, density, and pore size and was scanned
using X-Ray,  MDCT and MR. The voxel size (mm) in MDCT was of 0.234x0.236x0.67.
The MR sequence was a T2-GRE with a voxel of 0.146x0.146x0.5 mm. The image
processing steps were a bit different in X-Ray, MDCT, and MR, according to a
methodology developed in our group. Bone Volume to Total Volume (BV/TV) were
measured in order to define the bone percentage in the volume. Trabecular
Separation (Tb.Sp) was quantified by taking into account consecutive voxels
corresponding to marrow cavities. MR and MDCT measurements of trabecular bone
volume percentage and pore size were calibrated against the known ground truth
from synthetic bones. These results add insight into the validation of bone
microarchitecture imaging biomarkers.</p> </p>
