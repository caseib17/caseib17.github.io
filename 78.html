<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Recently the number of researchers using high throughput sequencing techniques
in their studies has grown significantly, and high throughput RNA-Seq has
validated its utility across a wide set of experiments. Moreover, differential
gene expression analysis has been one of the most important procedures to
analyse mRNA expression level between different conditions. 
RNA-Seq data analysis require specific bioinformatic processes depending on the
experimental paradigm. This study focuses on the bioinformatic protocols for
differential gene expression quantification between different conditions.
Differential expression analysis workflows have evolved including new features,
that aim to improve the specificity and sensibility of these analyses. Also,
these workflows not only improved by giving more accurate results, but also
have incorporated new algorithms reducing computational requirements. The
analysis of strengths and weakness between different protocols could be
interesting for the scientific community</p> </p>
