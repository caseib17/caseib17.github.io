<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>To prevent the sudden death risk, several methods have been proposed in
literature based on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) which is related with the
state of the autonomic nervous system. To quantify the HRV, the measurement of
the irregularity based on Entropy methods Multiscale Entropy and Multiscale
time irreversibility was performed. 
Higher entropy values have been reported in the literature for healthy states
than for some pathologies,  with the hypothesis that decreasing entropy points
to perturbations of the complex physiological mechanisms . To date, the MSE and
MTI have been analyzed for monitoring of a maximum of 24 hours, and a limit of
20 scales. In this work, we first analyze entropy and time irreversibility on
known synthetic signals. MSE and MTI methods are first used to analyze these
synthetic signals, by increasing the number of scales. Then, MSE and MTI are
applied to 7-days monitoring analysis of two data sets, namely, 3 patients with
Atrial Fibrillation and 3 patients with Heart Failure, by increasing the number
of scales up to 100, thanks to the long-term duration of the holter recordings.
Our results show that the elevated scales contain relevant information about
the patient's condition, which changes according to the pathology and the
patient, therefore, it paves the way to scfutinize these techniques in more
detail for their use in long-term cardiac monitoring scenarios.</p> </p>
