<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Technology is currently present in several areas of healthcare. The respiration rate (RR) along with the electrocardiogram (ECG) are important vital indicators whose values are often obtained by specific sensors. However, there is the possibility of effectively estimating RR from the electrocardiogram’s signal analysis, allowing a reduction of equipment costs, as well as an increase in user’s comfort. In this paper we propose an algorithm capable of detecting and evaluating respiratory cycles from an acquired ECG signals from a wearable device according to physiologically limits. For this purpose, two methods of self-evaluation were developed: the first using the duration and amplitude proper to the respiratory signals with 81.48% of precision and the second through the respiratory wave’s characteristics with 100% of precision. The performance of both methods was validated in order to analyse, selecting one for the final calculations of the main characteristics of the respiratory signal. The obtained results show that the proposed algorithm can perform very well with propensity for future improvement, given the importance of the theme and the study developed.</p> </p>
