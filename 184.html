<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Organs-on-a-chip enable good mimicking of pathophysiological
conditions, multicellular architecture, tissue-tissue interfaces and
physicochemical microenvironments in 2D and 3D. Skeletal
muscle has a unique 3D structure that facilitates contraction.
Biochemical, mechanical and electrical stimuli enable the
differentiation of muscle cells into myocytes. However, its
functionality highly depends on the microenvironment. The
purpose of this project was to replicate muscle fibre mimicking
physiological conditions through 3D bioprinting method in
combination with cell-laden hydrogels and sacrificial moulding
techniques. We first optimised the differentiation of C2C12
mouse myoblast into myocytes through biochemical stimuli and
performed a viability test embedding cells in different
combinations of ECM composites (Collagen I, Matrigel, and
alginate). The optimal ECM composition was used to bioprint a
muscle fibre. The results show the survival of myoblasts to
printing process and adequate proliferation and differentiation
afterwards. On the other hand, C2C12 myoblasts were transduced
with a lentivirus containing Channelrhodopsine-2 (ChR2),
differentiated and stimulated with light to induce contraction
afterwards. C2C12 ChR2+ cell line was successfully established,
though we are still optimising light stimulation parameters to
induce contraction. This study presents the basis of an in vitro
model for biomedical studies that combines biochemical and
optical stimuli, hydrogels and 3D bioprinting to enable successful
mimicking of muscle tissue.</p> </p>
