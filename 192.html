<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Wound healing is a specific biological process related to the general
phenomenon of tissue growth and regeneration, which
involves the combination of cells, scaffolds, and bioactive agents to fabricate
functional new tissue to replace damaged tissue. In previous research, it has
been investigated that not only psychological stress can delay wound healing
process but also the mechanical stresses that are produced due to the forces
generated by wounding affect this process. By this way, it can be confirmed
that there is a relationship between wound shape and wound healing. In our
current study, we found that stresses formed due to the forces were placed
mainly at wound corners. In addition, the experiments performed at Biodonostia
Health Research Institute, showed that the effect of stresses formed in wound
borders tend to form a new wound shape that can make it heal much faster. For
instance, rectangular and triangular wounds tend to become a circular form
because of the tension in the edges, meanwhile circular shape converts into a
more flattened circular profile.</p> </p>
