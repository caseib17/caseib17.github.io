<h4>Non-linear vibrations of an idealized saccular aneurysm</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Intracranial saccular aneurysms are a small portion of a vessel
that bulges outward forming a balloon like sac. Approximately
3% of the worldwide population suffer from this pathology and
its rupture entails subarachnoid haemorrhage, causing in most
of the cases brain damage or even death. Many physical and
clinical factors highly affect their evolution; however, the main
criteria for deciding their treatment is size.</p>

<p>The main contribution of this work is to develop a 3D
mathematical model to describe the behaviour of an idealized
intracranial saccular aneurysm. A study of its mechanical
behaviour is performed to understand under which conditions
the aneurysm will break. It is studied under three situations:
subjected to an internal constant pressure and surrounded by a
non-viscous Newtonian fluid, subjected to an internal constant
pressure and surrounded by a viscous Newtonian fluid and
subjected to an internal pulsatile pressure and surrounded by a
viscous Newtonian fluid. Then, some parameters as the total
pressure or the thickness of the wall are varied to understand
how they influence their rupture.</p> </p>
