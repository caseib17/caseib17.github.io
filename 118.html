<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Neurological diseases affecting the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), such as some Neuromuscular Diseases (NMD), often involve the afferent and efferent pathways of the PNS. Studying them requires mimicking the physiological microenvironment. The aim of this research is to use organs-on-a-chip technology to mimic the physiological microenvironment of the PNS, including myelination of Dorsal Root Ganglia neurons (DRGs) and motoneurons (MNs), providing the basis for future steps toward NMD study models. For that purpose, we first studied the viability of SW10 mouse Schwann cells when exposed to the media required for the primary culture of MNs or DRGs, observing SW10 viability decreased. These results suggested that a compartmentalised culture system is required. Schwann cells were also exposed to different biochemical stimuli to induce faster myelination, obtaining Horse Serum as a key component in the culture medium. A compartmentalised microfluidic device was fabricated, obtaining myelination of the PNS, seeding in different compartments Schwann cells with pro-myelinating medium with either primary MNs or DRGs. The afferent pathway of the PNS was successfully mimicked, whereas we faced some difficulties in working with MNs and analysing myelin sheath formation through transmission electron microscopy. To sum up, we have designed a PNS model that still needs to be optimised to better mimic the efferent pathway. This model provides the basis for further research on PNS and offers the possibility of an in vitro tool PNS and NMD diseases models.</p> </p>
