<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) translate neural activity into control commands for assistive and prosthetic devices. In this project, Long-short term memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network architecture, was applied to BMI control and compared to several decoding algorithms. Offline decoding was tested on neuronal population recordings in motor cortex of a monkey performing a center-out task using a joystick. Hyper-parameter optimization was performed using grid search so as to obtain network parameters that maximized decoder performance. The optimized LSTM learned quickly, and significantly outperformed the decoder Wiener filter. In the online implementation, LSTM decoded activity of approximately 150 motor cortical neurons and enabled a monkey to perform center-out reaching movements to eight peripheral targets. LSTM online performance exceeded that of the Unscented Kalman Filter, as judged by the number of correctly performed trials, decoded trajectory straightness and trajectory length to target as measures of accuracy. These results suggest that LSTM can replace many of current decoders in scientific and clinical BMI implementations.</p> </p>
